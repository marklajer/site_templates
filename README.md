# Reclaim Hosting Site Templates
In 2016 [cPanel](http://cpanel.com/) introduced the [Site Publisher](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/ALD/Site+Publisher) feature which allows end-users a quick and easy way of publishing a basic static HTML page to their domain. Web hosting providers also have the ability to build custom templates for Site Publisher. This repository contains all of Reclaim Hosting's additional templates provided with a open source license.

##Usage
These instructions assume you have no other custom templates. If you do, you'll need to manually download the repo and upload the individual folders to your **site_templates** folder.
